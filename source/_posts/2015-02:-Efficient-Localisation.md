Today me and Martin ([@mdevilleinfo](http://twitter.com/mdevilleinfo)) had the opportunity to talk to some amazing people at the Cocoaheads Meetup in Berlin.

The meetup was heald at the headquarters of [OneFootball](http://www.onefootball.com/) and was a very welcoming environment. We met some nice people, had some beers and shared our learnings with localisation at Memorado.

Currently only 10 people work at Memorado, and despite its young age and small team size, we are able to deliver an amazing brain training platform to over 3.5 Million users in 21 different languages. We think this huge success can be partly attributed to our efforts in localising our app efficiently, and it was really rewarding to have the opportunity to share some of these thoughts with the community.

I would like to thank everyone who was there and listened to our talk. Really looking forward for the next gatherings.
