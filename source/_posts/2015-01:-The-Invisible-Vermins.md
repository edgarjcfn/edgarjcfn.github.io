Dr. Alice Young looked at the projected screen and let her jaw drop with a gasp. She was sitting on the front row and the presenter had made a pause to let the selected audience in a small auditorium digest his words and absorb what was being shown on the screen.

Dr. Young couldn't believe her eyes. "If this is true, my profession will never be the same" she thought. "No, no. It will more likely cease to exist."

Alice had been a practicing psychiatrist for 20 years. She always strived to find a balance between academic research and attending to patients in her well-decorated office in the center of London. In all these years, Alice had accumulated two Ph.D.'s at the expense of having little to no social life. The plans of starting a family were constantly postponed to tomorrow, even though at her age, tomorrow felt more and more like a yesterday that never came. 

It was a rainy thursday night when she received an invite for the presentation that would change her life. At that point, the accomplished doctor thought that nothing could surprise her in the field of research in psychosexual depression, and was mostly intrigued when she realised the invitation had come from the MIT Media Lab.

"What could they possibly want with me?" She thought.

She was about to dismiss the invite a mistake, when she realised, much to her surprise, that the e-mail was not addressed only to her but included the most influential researchers in many fields of psychiatry. The list included both her advisors for her Ph.D.'s, an award-winning best-seller writer, and the biggest surprise of all, Dr. Rajesh Mohanty who was nominated for a Nobel Prize a few years back, for his advancements in the field of post-traumatic stress disorder for children born in areas of conflict.

Dr. Young felt honored to even be on the same list as these people. She was not exactly sure what american researchers in the field of audio-visual technologies want with world-famous researchers in psychiatry, but they certainly had her attention.

In the next few days, there was little else that she could think about. She found herself distant and distracted while listening to her patients. Alice would convince herself it was out of scientific curiosity that she was loosing sleep over that invitation. But she knew herself way too well: vanity and thirst for recognition were hastening her heart just as much.

The curiosity had grown with anxiety. When the morning of the flight finally arrived, Alice was sitting on the edge of the bed, fully alert, as the alarm clock on her nightstand started buzzing. She quickly turned it off, and made for the airport.

After a long and tiring trip, she was finally dragging her rolling suitcase through the Boston Airport where she was approached by a short man, extending his chubby hands in her direction.

"Dr. Young, I assume. We are very pleased to have you here."
"I'm glad to be here"
"My name is Ben Ford, I'm a faculty assistent at the MIT and I'll be bringing you to your hotel"

He was helpful and liked to smile. So much that it made Alice uncomfortable. In the car, on the way to their hotel in Cambridge, she finally asked:
"Do you happen to know what this presentation is about? The invite didn't say much about it."
Ford smiled. "We made some ground-breaking discoveries Dr. Young. And we stumbled upon your field of research. I believe you'll be just as astonished as we were".
"What discoveries? What advancements in audivisual technology can possibly have something to do with psychiatry?"
Ford's smile grew wider. "Everything in due time, Doctor."

Alice met the world's lead researchers in psychiatry on the same night at the hotel lobby. She felt awkwardly among them, as if she didn't belong there. She couldn't believe someone would consider her a peer to these people. Yet, there she was.

The next day they were led into a small auditorium inside the MIT Campus, where the mysterious presentation was finally about to begin. There was no elevated stage and the audience was made of no more than 15 people. In the center
