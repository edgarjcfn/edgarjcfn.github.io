Dr. Alice Young looked at the projected screen and let her jaw drop with a gasp. The presenter had made a pause to let the selected audience in a the small auditorium digest what was being shown on the screen. "If this is true, my profession will never be the same." Dr. Young thought. "No, no. It will more likely cease to exist."

Alice had been a practicing psychiatrist for 20 years. She always strived to find a balance between academic research and attending to patients in her well-decorated office in the center of London. In all these years, Alice had accumulated two Ph.D.'s at the expense of having little to no social life. The plans of starting a family were constantly postponed to tomorrow, even though at her age, tomorrow felt more and more like a yesterday that never came. 

It was a rainy thursday night when she read an e-mail with the invite for the presentation that would change her life. At that point, the accomplished doctor thought that nothing else could surprise her in the field of research in psychosexual depression, and was mostly intrigued when she realised the invitation had come from the MIT Media Lab.

"What could they possibly want with me?" She thought.

Much to her surprise she realised that the invitation was not addressed only to her but included the most influential researchers in many fields of psychiatry. The list included both her advisors for her Ph.D.'s, an award-winning best-seller writer, and the cherry on top of the cake, Dr. Rajesh Mohanty who was nominated for a Nobel Prize a few years back, for his advancements in the field of post-traumatic stress disorder for children born in areas of conflict.

Dr. Young felt flattered to even be on the same list as these people. She was not exactly sure what american researchers in the field of audio-visual technologies want with world-famous researchers in psychiatry, but she was curious enought to try it out.
