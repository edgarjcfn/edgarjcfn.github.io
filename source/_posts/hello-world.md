I've tried blogging many times.
I've stopped blogging even more times.
Let's give this a try again.

I'm creating this blog because I need a place to dump all my ideas. I figured some of the things I want to share are not very fitting into a social network like Facebook and also don't fit into 140 characters for Twitter. Falling into this category are especially some more technical explanations of my pet projects and what comes out of my eventual adventures into fiction writing.
