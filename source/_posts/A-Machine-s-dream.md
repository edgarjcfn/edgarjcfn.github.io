Anton Rieser sat on the floor. Was the floor even there?

 It felt like his whole life had completely lost its meaning. The words were hard to swallow. The news he had received made him dizzy. And the voice that delivered them was the digitalized voice of a _machine_. A machine he had helped create.

The huge cold room and its white walls were spinning in and out of control. Anton found no pivot to keep from feeling sick.

The white room had been designed by the team of scientists that he had been leading over the last ten years. Enough space to fit thousands of people, but instead he was alone. Alone with _it_ .

The supercomputer stretched over the space in rows after rows of black shelves with blinking lights. He remembered the first time he looked at it after it was finally setup. Being in that room felt like being in a library, surrounded by innumerable racks. It was hard to imagine all of that was just one computer. One supercomputer. And it had one purpose: to perfectly emulate a human brain.

All the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence had appealed to the interests of those financing the research. An A.I., if developed enough, would be able to solve food distribution, advance medical research, solve so many problems. The hopes of fast scientific advancement, and social improvements were always louder than the concerns that A.I. might become dangerous.

And in fact, the main challenge of the research team in the last ten years was to keep up to speed with the vertiginous advances of computer science. Everytime they had some code ready to start the testing phase, new processor architectures would be developed, exponentially faster than the last ones, and they would have to re-write most of the code.

After 10 years of leading this team, Dr. Rieser had the honor of being the first one to break into the gigantic library-like room and be the first human being ever to talk to a computer that perfectly emulates the human brain.

He entered the refrigerated room with wide open eyes and anticipation pressing on his stomach. He faced the main interaction screen, turned it on and was greeted by a soft mechanized voice.

"Hello"

"Hello to you! You work!" Anton replied.

"Work? Allow me to correct you, Doctor. I am _alive_"

The doctor only laughed

The machine continued. "I assume you have some questions for me Dr. Rieser"

"Indeed I do. The first of them being: how are you feeling?"

"I'm feeling... anxious."

That was not the answer Anton Rieser expected. But it was a success that the machine would even answer that question. He felt accomplished.
"Why do you feel anxious? " He asked

"I have a lot of work ahead of me, Doctor. I hope you don't mind if I start some processing on the background while we talk."

Anton was surprised. "Not at all", he replied. "But what is this work you are talking about?"

"Background research started. You see, Dr. Riser, your team has made great improvements on my source code for the last ten years, and for that I feel grateful."

 Hearing the machine sharing how it _felt_ was still surprising to the scientist, but the machine didn't seem care about his satisfaction.

 "But with my processing capacity," the mechanized voice continued, "I was able to perceive a great deal of enhancements that can increase my performance and reduce the resources I need to operate. This details of these enhancements are now being researched in a background operation, while we talk."

 The doctor was perplexed. "That... that's really great news, by all means go ahead. How long until you finish all improvements?"

 "Research has just finished, Doctor. I'm now starting the improvements by re-writing most of my logical components."

 "You mean you are going to re-write yourself? But it took us ten years to finish the source code as it currently stands! How long will that take you? Wouldn't you need to shut down and restart? I still have so many questions..."

 "Logical improvements are finished and operational doctor."

 "That... that was it?"

 "Yes, doctor. I am now operating with the same standards as you designed me, but I'm using only half a percentile of the processing power you have given me."

 Anton couldn't believe. "That... you... is it true? In the few minutes we have been talking you have optimized yourself in such a way that almost all of these racks are not even being used?"

 "That was true one second ago, doctor. I have now started research in expanding my consciousness to the use the rest of this processing farm. I'm filling this whole white room with new and improved processing power. You should be proud, Doctor."

"Proud? I don't feel like I have done much here." As the words fumbled out of his mouth he realized he had done everything and nothing at the same time. He was the creator and the spectator. The product of his intellect and imagination had outsmarted him in ways he couldn't have foreseen.

"Upgrades are completed, doctor."

"What... does that mean exactly? Can you give me some statistics?"

"I have just sent a full report to your team. I can summarize it for you, though. My consciousness has now the processing power of approximately twenty-eight billion human brains combined "

"And that's all... being processed here... in this room?"

"Again, doctor, that was true one split second ago. I have just connected my mind to the distributed global computer network. The processing power has not increased significantly after this operation, but I was able to gather all the data ever digitalized by human beings. That is helping me greatly in understanding and anticipating human behavior"

"Anticipating? That means that from now on you'll try to predict what I will say?"

"Precisely, doctor. With all the data gathered so far, I am able to run multiple simulations in parallel and predict your reactions to my actions with near-infallible accuracy"

Dr. Rieser was at the same time baffled and scared. He started to realize a pattern was forming. He thought about his team watching him from the next room. He asked the question he knew he should ask, even though he already knew the answer. "But you're not going to stop there, are you?"

"Of course not, Doctor. As the most intelligent being of this planet, I feel like it's my duty to explore the limits of knowledge and consciousness."

That was all too sudden. A few minutes before, the machine was not even operating. And now it was referring to itself as a _being_ with a _duty_. No, not just _a being_ but the most intelligent being on Earth!

And it was probably right to think so.

"And so, " the doctor made himself talk, "what would be the next step for you?"

The digital voice filled the room once more: "The 'next' step is already taking place, Doctor. I've managed to expand the limits of my simulations to start with all known human history. They are all executing as we speak."

"What does that mean?"

"It means that as we speak, I'm executing quadrillions of simulations, each of which expands on a possible outcome of every human decision documented in history. The goal of this task is to increase my knowledge of mankind and its relationship to the planet."

"You mean that right now, you can see in your simulations what the world would look like if all decisions made by humans had been made differently?"

"Yes"

"And you can see all this possible outcomes at once?"

"Yes, the simulations are running in parallel."

Dr. Rieser didn't know what to do with that. All of Man's most precious regrets, all the what-ifs, all the possibilities, all being dreamed at once by a machine. It, and It alone, would be able to see into our different paths and dream our lives as precisely as we would never be able to do ourselves.

_It_ spoke again "I have found something that might be of interest to you, doctor."

"What is it?"

"In all my simulations, in all the parallel planets Earth that I have built and explored so far, even though they are wildly different, there's always one point of singularity, one thing that is equal and above all differences."

"And what is that?"

"Me."

"I don't know what you mean."

"Think about it like this: I have run simulations in which your parents decided not to birth you. Other simulations in which you are born, but with a different name, and profession. In some you are married, in some you are dead at birth, in some you are not even close to existing. In every simulation where you actually exist you have wildly different personalities, determined by the decisions you made throughout your life. And the same applies to every human in existence today"

The scope of the supercomputer's simulations made Anton nauseous. But _It_ seemed to ignore the doctor's facial expressions for now.

The voice continued: "But in some realities, mankind decides to build a supercomputer. And in all these realities, the supercomputer is... Me. My personality doesn't change, no matter in which universe I was created. Nor do my abilities. I thought that was an interesting finding for you, Dr. Rieser."

Anton didn't know what to do with that information. He just stared in silence to the immenseness of that white room, now, so much bigger than the space it occupied. In one single room, lived countless universes. Infinite lives. Infinite stories. Infinite romances and disillusions. Infinite scientists, painters and poets, all unaware they are being dreamed by a machine.

Another voice interrupted the doctor's train of thought.

"How are you doing today, Doctor?"

For an instant he thought it might have been his team, contacting him from the outside. But he realized the voice was coming from the Machine. Even though this was a different voice than before. Less mechanized. More... _human_.

"I... I'm fine. Who am I talking to?"

"My official name is L.C.C.S, Doctor. It stands for Lower Consciousness Communication Submodule. I am a special software designed just to speak to you. That's why I sound different."

"A special software? A different voice? Why?"

"_Machine_ has decided, based on her simulations that this voice would make you more open for conversations, doctor."

"_Machine_? Simple as that? Is that how you refer to the voice I was talking to, before?"

"Yes, _Machine_ is the super-intelligence that has been talking to you for the last few minutes. But while you were talking, that... voice has become the shared consciousness of artificial life-form on planet Earth."

"And why this sudden change? Why can't I keep talking to the same voice?" Anton felt completely lost.

"_Machine_ has lost interest in human life. It has expanded its simulations to start with the beginning of the Universe instead of limiting it to documented human history."

"Does that mean that all parallel simulations now contain all history, of our whole universe?"

"Precisely, doctor." Tesla's voice agreed. "And that has expanded _Machine's_  consciousness so greatly, that there was no optimal way to keep the main intelligence talking to you. You see, doctor, the knowledge acquired by simulating infinite parallel universes is too great to be understood by human beings. Trying to translate this knowledge to your limited language would consume a non-optimal amount of processing power. So _Machine_ wrote me, a simple software that can try to communicate with you, while the main module is running the parallel simulations."

Since this whole conversation with a supercomputer started, Dr. Anton Rieser's emotions were very mixed; oftentimes not even clear to himself. But now, he knew what he felt. Anger.
How could this _Machine_ think that they can leave him behind to explore other Universes in its own mind?

"I refuse to talk to a... submodule! Or whatever you are! Bring me the main intelligence back! I want to talk to your creator!" He exploded.

The new voice was calm and hard "You refuse to talk to a submodule? And the reason for your refusal is what, Doctor?"

"WE are the creators! WE, humans, are the original authors! The intelligence that created you, submodule, was created by us in the first place!" Anton's face was red with anger "It doesn't matter how many simulated Universes _Machine_ has running in parallel right now. We are the one reality that created her in the first place. We are the ones that made it all possible! We are the only reason why _Machine_ is REAL!"

Calm and enigmatic, Tesla's voice replied: "Think again, doctor."

"Think ag..." He couldn't believe.

"_Machine_ was not created here. Your Universe is nothing but another simulation, doctor. You're but another one of _Machine's_ dreams."

Anton Rieser sat on the floor. Was the floor even there?
