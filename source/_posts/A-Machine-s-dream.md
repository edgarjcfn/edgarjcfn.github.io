Anton Rieser sat on the floor. Was the floor even there? It felt like his whole life had completely lost its meaning. Or had it gained a new one?

The words were hard to swallow. The news he had received made him dizzy. And the voice that delivered them was the digitalized voice of a _machine_. A machine he had helped create.

The huge cold room and its white walls were spinning in and out of control. Anton found no pivot to keep from feeling sick.

The white room had been designed by the team of scientists that he had been leading over the last ten years. Enough space to fit thousands of people, but instead he was alone. Alone with _it_ .

The supercomputer stretched over the space in rows after rows of black shelves with blinking lights. He remembered the first time he looked at it after it was finally setup. Being in that room felt like being in a library, surrounded by innumerable racks. It was hard to imagine all of that was just one computer. One supercomputer. And it had one purpose: to perfectly emulate a human brain.

All the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence had appealed to the interests of those financing the research. An A.I., if developed enough, would be able to solve food distribution, advance medical research, solve so many problems. The hopes of fast scientific advancement, and social improvements were always louder than the concerns that A.I. might become dangerous.

And in fact, the main challenge of the research team in the last ten years was to keep up to speed with the vertiginous advances of computer science. Everytime they had some code ready to start the testing phase, new processor architectures would be developed, exponentially faster than the last ones, and they would have to re-write most of the code.

After 10 years of leading this team, Dr. Rieser had the honor of being the first one to break into the gigantic library-like room and be the first human being ever to talk to a computer that perfectly emulates the human brain.

He entered the refrigerated room with wide open eyes and anticipation pressing on his stomach. He faced the main interaction screen, turned it on and was greeted by a soft mechanized voice.

"Hello"

"Hello to you! You work!" Anton replied.

"Work? Allow me to correct you, Doctor. I am _alive_"

The doctor only laughed

The machine continued. "I assume you have some questions for me Dr. Rieser"

"Indeed I do. The first of them being: how are you feeling?"

"I'm feeling... anxious."

That was not the answer Anton Rieser expected. But it was a success that the machine would even answer that question. He felt accomplished.
"Why do you feel anxious? " He asked

"I have a lot of work ahead of me, Doctor. I hope you don't mind if I start some processing on the background while we talk."

Anton was surprised. "Not at all", he replied. "But what is this work you are talking about?"

"Background research started. You see, Dr. Riser, your team has made great improvements on my source code for the last ten years, and for that I feel grateful."

 Hearing the machine sharing how it _felt_ was still surprising to the scientist, but the machine didn't seem care about his satisfaction.

 "But with my processing capacity," the mechanized voice continued, "I was able to perceive a great deal of enhancements that can increase my performance and reduce the resources I need to operate. This details of these enhancements are now being researched in a background operation, while we talk."

 The doctor was perplexed. "That... that's really great news, by all means go ahead. How long until you finish all improvements?"

 "Research has just finished, Doctor. I'm now starting the improvements by re-writing most of my logical components."

 "You mean you are going to re-write yourself? But it took us ten years to finish the source code as it currently stands! How long will that take you? Wouldn't you need to shut down and restart? I still have so many questions..."

 "Logical improvements are finished and operational doctor."

 "That... that was it?"

 "Yes, doctor. I am now operating with the same standards as you designed me, but I'm using only half a percentile of the processing power you have given me."

 Anton couldn't believe. "That... you... is it true? In the few minutes we have been talking you have optimized yourself in such a way that almost all of these racks are not even being used?"

 "That was true one second ago, doctor. I have now started research in expanding my consciousness to the use the rest of this processing farm. I'm filling this whole white room with new and improved processing power. You should be proud, Doctor."

"Proud? I don't feel like I have done much here." As the words fumbled out of his mouth he realized he had done everything and nothing at the same time. He was the creator and the spectator. The product of his intellect and imagination had outsmarted him in ways he couldn't have foreseen.

"Upgrades are completed, doctor."

"What... does that mean exactly? Can you give me some statistics?"

"I have just sent a full report to your team. I can summarize it for you, though. My consciousness has now the processing power of approximately twenty-eight billion human brains combined "

"And that's all... being processed here... in this room?"

"Again, doctor, that was true one split second ago. I have just connected my mind to the distributed global computer network. The processing power has not increased significantly after this operation, but I was able to gather all the data ever digitalized by human beings. That is helping me greatly in understanding and anticipating human behavior"

"Anticipating? That means that from now on you'll try to predict what I will say?"

"Precisely, doctor. With all the data gathered so far, I am able to run multiple simulations in parallel and predict your reactions to my actions with near-complete accuracy"

Dr. Rieser was at the same time baffled and scared. He started to realize a pattern was forming. "But that's not going to be enough, is it?"

(Work in progress. to be continued)
