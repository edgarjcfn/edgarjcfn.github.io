Anton Rieser sat on the floor. Was the floor even there? It felt like his whole life had completely lost its meaning. Or had it gained a new one?

The words were hard to swallow. The news he had received made him dizzy. And the voice that delivered them was the digitalized voice of a _machine_.

The huge cold room and its white walls were spinning in and out of control. Anton found no pivot to keep from feeling sick.

The white room had been designed by the team of scientists that he had been leading over the last ten years. Enough space to fit thousands of people, but instead he was alone. Alone with _it_ .

The supercomputer stretched over the space in rows after rows of black shelves with blinking lights. He remembered the first time he looked at it after it was finally setup. Being in that room felt like being in a library, surrounded by innumerable racks. It was hard to imagine all of that was just one computer. One supercomputer.

All the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence had appealed to the interests of those financing the research and develop A.I. would be able to solve food distribution, advance medical research. The hopes of fast scientific advancement, and social improvements were always louder than the concerns that A.I. might become dangerous.

And in fact, the main challenge of the research team in the last ten years was to keep track of the vertiginous speed of scientific advancements. Everytime they had some code ready to start the testing phase, new processor architectures would be developed, exponentially faster than the last ones, and they would have to re-write most of the code.

After 10 years of leading this team, Dr. Rieser had the honour of being the first one to break into the gigantic library-like room and be the first human being ever to talk to a computer that perfectly emulates the human brain.

He entered the refrigerated room with wide open eyes and antecipation pressing on his stomach. He faced the main interaction screen, turned it on and was greeted by a soft mechanized voice.

"Hello"

"Hello to you! You work!" Anton replied.

"Work? Allow me to correct you, Doctor. I am _alive_"

The doctor only laughed

The machine continued. "I assume you have some questions for me Dr. Rieser"

"Indeed I do. The first of them being: how are you feeling?"

"I'm feeling... anxious."

That was not the answer Anton Rieser expected. But it was a success that the machine would even answer that question. He felt accomplished.
"Why do you feel anxious? " He asked
