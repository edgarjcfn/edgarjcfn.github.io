title: Seeking win-win as a startup developer
tags:
---
Here, write about the thinking about your carreer path as an investment.
Strong skills are your flagship product, but you should keep
experimenting with other technologies to keep an open array of
possibilities. 

Write about the trade-off: array of skills vs array of locations to
work. The more skills you have, the more you can choose to stay at one
place. The more you specialize in one skill, the broader you have to
keep your options of locations to live in.

Finally illustrate win-win with my relationship with Memorado.
