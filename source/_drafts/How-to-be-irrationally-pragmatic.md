Outline
# Accept that you don't choose what you like
The things that fire a passion inside of us are completely out of our control. They determine how much time we are willing to spend on certain activities
They determine why some people get a kick out of woodworking while other get a kick out of spreadsheets and graphs
# Rationality keeps you safe, irrationality makes you happy
Reference the German TED Talk, Ste Curran's "in the time it takes a heart to beat", my own examples
# Stop time-travelling
Accept that you don't have control over the past or over the future.
The sensation of control over the future is a mere illusion (DDR disappearing, sudden deaths, etc.)
Accept that you can only control the present
# Pick your battles
Choose your main goals with your heart. Travel the path and minimize risks with your brain. Example: the switch to Memorado, moving in together.
# Stop following stuff on the outside. Instead, follow your internal compass.
