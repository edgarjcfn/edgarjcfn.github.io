title: The Social Media Detox

Why social media is bad? When people go against social media and say anything about a detox, there's a bunch of people who counter-argument with the good things about social media. We need to separate 2 concepts: communication from newsfeed. Communication = Shallow (like, comment with sticker, poke) + Deep (comment, discuss, post). Newsfeed = evil. Designed to trick your mind. Slot Machine effect. Makes you not be able to drop your phone.

How to use just the good parts of social media? Kill the newsfeed somehow? Keep the ability to post, discuss, comment without being addicted to the newsfeed? The problem with killing the newsfeed = how to discover content and be up-to-date?! 

Today, 16th of Feb, halfway through the challenge I just got rid of Reddit and Hacker News. But I feel muted. Want to post  discover and share, don't know how.
