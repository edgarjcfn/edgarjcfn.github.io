title: Traits of a good developer
tags:
---
In this article write about the question I got from the guys at Tyba about what makes a great developer. I thought about it after, and come to some conclusions that are not included in the video.

1 - Talks about code naturally
...
2 - Measures instead of assuming
...
3 - Tests in the same dimension as he develops
 If you are developing a visual feature, you don't need unit tests. If you are developing a feature that deals with a ton of data transformation and then shows it in the screen, you don't test only the screen.
