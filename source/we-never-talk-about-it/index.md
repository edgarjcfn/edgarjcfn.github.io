title: We never talk about it

What I'm about to write happened four years ago. We haven't talked about it since, but something happened today that made me decide to put it into writing.

#####The backstory:
My mother-in-law was staying us to help with my (then) newborn son. Me and my wife were planning a baby for a few months before we got pregnant so we were pretty happy and excited about the baby. He was six weeks premature and we had to stay short of four weeks in the hospital with him before we could actually bring him home. On the night of what happened we were home for just two days. That makes for a great deal of exhaustion appended to all our joy. But the baby was with us, that was all that mattered. When it happened, we were all sitting down to have a normal dinner.

#####The happening:
A "happening" is the best word I can find to explain it. There was no reason behind it, and no explanation afterwards. I still remember with vivid detail. Me, my wife and my mother in law were sitting at the dinner table. The baby was sleeping in the baby wagon next to us, closer to the door. I had my back to the living room door and my mother-in-law sat opposite to me. We were all chatting about something non-important. What happened next was all in just a matter of seconds: My mother-in-law looked suddenly at the living room door and the color fled completely from her face. Her eyes and mouth were wide open and she was pointing at the door behind me without words. I quickly turned around, scared that something was happening to the baby, but then I saw it.

#####The creature:
A dog-sized black creature was crawling right through the door and making its way to the baby wagon. It had bright yellow eyes, big bat-like ears and no back paws. It seemed to walk by dragging itself with its thin, long and twisted front paws. The "face", if I can call it that, had no snout and resembled that of a giant bat, with bright red fur circling around the back of the neck. The eyes - agh, those eyes! I shiver just to remember. They were big and shiny and wide open and seemed to look directly at the baby wagon, yet they seemed lifeless. (Just by reading what I just wrote I understand clearly how crazy it all sounds that this creature appeared out of nowhere and how surreal it actually was. Maybe this is the biggest reason why we don't talk about it at home.) But what's most surreal about the "creature" was that it didn't look completely solid. I'm almost sure I could see a part of the floor wood through it and its movements were not exactly in sync with reality. This is the best description I can make of the creature, as crazy as it sounds. What follows is the description of the very few seconds we managed to deal with it.

#####The happening (continues):
I froze completely for a few seconds. When I could finally move, my wife and mother-in-law were screaming their full lungs. I moved towards the creature that looked from me, to the baby, back to me and approached the baby wagon (slowly but surely, dragging its non-existent rear paws). It then looked at me, hissed like a scared cat, and charged in my direction. I (somehow) managed to jump over it and out of a reflex, kicked it in the back. Because I didn't calculate this move, I sent it flying towards the dinner table where it hit with a low thump. It seemed to move slower after that and my wife, who by now had stopped screaming, delivered another kick, this time to the face. That one seem to do it and the creature stopped moving. We looked at each other and then back to the creature, when (as surreal as it sounds) it just vanished. It seemed to melt into a dark shadow spreading over the living room floor that then just disappeared. It sounds crazy, but that's what happened.

#####The aftermath:
We were all pretty shaky after what happened and I remember the three of us spending hours discussing what that... thing could have been, none able to finish dinner. It was daylight when we finally retired to our beds, but even so, I didn't sleep one second that day. Yet, in the next few days we seemed to talk less and less about it, each one convincing themselves it was not completely true. By the day we dropped my mother-in-law back at the airport, not a word was said about it anymore. Instead a deeply sad, awkward silence filled the spaces in the conversations when someone wanted to mention the happening.

#####The present:
Today was my son's four year-old birthday. He had a big party, with friends, family and good food. When it was finally bedtime, I read him a story and kissed him good night. I was turning away to the door when I heard him calling me. "Daddy"
"Yes?" - I turned around
"Thank you."
"You're welcome, son. Did you like your party?"
"Not for the party. Thank you for saving me from the big black devil".
I froze.
We had never talked about it since.
We will never talk about it again.
